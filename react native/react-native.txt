1) Create react app with init
react-native init basics

2) Start application
react-native run-android

3)Jsx extension cannot be used with react native

4) FlatList is more opti,ized than scrollview

5) Importing image in react native
Normal import using import statement - 
import placeImage from "./src/assets/img.jpg";

here while using it inside image component , react native preserves actual height and width of that image, thoug we can override it in styles, and also that by default mode is cover
eg - 
      <Image source={props.placeImage} style={styles.placeImage} />


Using Network Image
it takes object with uri property which contains address url of image . Note that in this case it is necessary to give height and width of image

      <Image
        source={{
          uri:
            "data:image/jpeg;base64,/9j/4AAQSkZJRgABAQAAAQABAAD/2wCEAAkGBxIS+xvou7DS+Uz9jfRULkBP2/Z"
        }}
        style={styles.placeImage}
      />

6) Link external package automatically
react-native link  react-native-fs


7) Using react native debugger 
first import compose
import { createStore, combineReducers, compose } from "redux";

then

let composeEnhancers = compose;

if (__DEV__) {
  composeEnhancers = window.__REDUX_DEVTOOLS_EXTENSION_COMPOSE__ || compose;
}

then inside create store

const store = createStore(allReducers, composeEnhancers());




6.1) Use stylesheet.create when there are no dynamic styles and use normal const={} style when we get dynamic styles from porps or other





7) Installing 3rd party modules
eg - react-native-vector-icons

first install that package - 
npm install react-native-vector-icons --save




8) Navigation in react
Two options - 
1) react navigation
2) react native navigation


React native navigation, install with given steps in docs
then - 

For navigation using single screen app - 

In App.js
import { Navigation } from "react-native-navigation";

import AuthScreen from "./src/screens/Auth/Auth";

//Register Screens
Navigation.registerComponent("awesome-places.AuthScreen", () => AuthScreen);

//Start a App
Navigation.startSingleScreenApp({
  screen: {
    screen: "awesome-places.AuthScreen",
    title: "Login"
  }
});


then create a new folder in src called screens and create a component called Auth and in it - 

import React, { Component } from "react";
import { View, Text } from "react-native";

class AuthScreen extends Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <View>
        <Text> Auth Screen</Text>
      </View>
    );
  }
}

export default AuthScreen;






______________________________________________________________

9) React navigation
App.js - 
import React from "react";
import { View, Text } from "react-native";
import { createStackNavigator } from "react-navigation";
import LoginScreen from "./src//components/LoginScreen";
import HomeScreen from "./src/components/HomeScreen";

export default class App extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return <AppStackNavigator />;
  }
}

//Create Navigation Here
const AppStackNavigator = createStackNavigator(
  {
    Login: LoginScreen,
    Home: HomeScreen
  },
  {
    initialRouteName: "Login"
  }
);


Remember to import and export child component withNavigation to child component

import { withNavigation } from "react-navigation";
export default withNavigation(LinksComponent);

To navigate on diff page with putton
        <Button
          title="Goto Home Screen"
          onPress={() => this.props.navigation.navigate("Home")}
        />


to create goback button - 
        <Button
          title="Go Back"
          onPress={() => this.props.navigation.goBack()}
        />


To disable header, inside that component inside class and above render
  static navigationOptions = {
    header: null
  };




________________________________________________________________




				Styles
1) Import StyleSheet and use it to give styles
2) dont use px or rem and when giving percentage give it as a string
3)Reusable component styling
give style in reusable component and then in pass {...props} and in parent component we can pass extra props 
eg reusable component
<TextInput style={[styles.input,props.style]} {...props} />

4) To style multiple text, we trap it inside another text element as we cannot give style related to font to view

5)ImageBackground component is used to give background image

6) If we add wrapping view to our already styled elements and everything mess up then apply width 100% and align items center to wrapping div

7) Different styles for different platform
there are 2 ways to achieve that
first is to have diff entyrpoint files like index.ios.js and index.android.js
second is using platform api to detect on which platform the code is running.


8) For responsive design that is to make work our app in both poitrait and landscape mode , we use dimensions api

to style for both modes, create a state called view and check in there which view mode it is using get dimensions 
then create diff style for diff modes and then apply to components styles based on view mode in state

					Maps in react native
while installing note that
   implementation 'com.google.android.gms:play-services-base:11.0.4'
   implementation 'com.google.android.gms:play-services-maps:11.0.4'

			Redux with RN and navigation

make sure that there is no extra view here
     <Provider store={store}>
        <AppStackNavigator />
      </Provider>


eg - 
app.js
/**
 * Sample React Native App
 * https://github.com/facebook/react-native
 *
 * @format
 * @flow
 */

import React, { Component } from "react";
import FirstScreen from "./screens/FirstScreen";
import SecondScreen from "./screens/SecondScreen";
import {
  Platform,
  StyleSheet,
  Text,
  View,
  TextInput,
  Button
} from "react-native";

import { createStackNavigator } from "react-navigation";
import { createBottomTabNavigator } from "react-navigation";

import { applyMiddleware, createStore } from "redux";
import { Provider } from "react-redux";
import { composeWithDevTools } from "redux-devtools-extension";
import rootReducer from "./reducers/rootReducer";

const store = createStore(rootReducer, {}, composeWithDevTools());

export default class App extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <Provider store={store}>
        <AppStackNavigator />
      </Provider>
    );
  }
}

//Create Navigation Here
const AppStackNavigator = createBottomTabNavigator(
  {
    Input: FirstScreen,
    Details: SecondScreen
  },
  {
    initialRouteName: "Input",
    tabBarPosition: "bottom",
    swipeEnabled: true,
    animationEnabled: true,
    activeTintColor: "red",
    inactiveTintColor: "red",
    tabBarOptions: {
      style: {
        backgroundColor: "#841584",
        borderTopWidth: 0,
        paddingBottom: 16
      },
      labelStyle: {
        color: "white",
        fontWeight: "bold",
        fontSize: 13
      }
    }
  }
);




________________________________________________________________


Create a circular view
    const style = {
        width: size,
        height: size,
        borderRadius: size / 2,
        backgroundColor,
    }



________________________________________________________________



				Flexbox in RN
1)  A component must have both a non-zero width and height in order to render anythingonthescreen.Ifthewidthis0,thennothingwillrenderonthescreen,nomatterhowlarge the height is.


2) flex: 1,
here  The flex value is a number that represents the ratio of space that a component should take up, relative to its siblings. 

• with a flex of 1, the component will expand to fill its parent entirely 
• with a flex value of 0, the component will shrink to the minimum space possible (just large enough for the component’s children to be visible, if it has any)

Error - Skipping device 'MNSCY5LJF6YTBUMZ' (MNSCY5LJF6YTBUMZ): Device is null.


I've seen this error a few times when adb hasn't been connected with correct permissions.

On the terminal try
~/Android/Sdk/platform-tools> ./adb devices

if it returns
<deviceIdentifier> no permissions

then you need to restart adb with correct perms
~/Android/Sdk/platform-tools$> ./adb kill-server
~/Android/Sdk/platform-tools$> sudo ./adb devices

if that worked then you'll get
List of devices attached
* daemon not running. starting it now on port 5037 *
* daemon started successfully *
<deviceIdentifier>  device

No more Sdk version resolution issues in Android Studio after that.
